# Function and Class Components

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:

```js
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.

# Rendering a Component

Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:

```js
const element = <div />;
```

However, elements can also represent user-defined components:

```js
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.

For example, this code renders “Hello, Sara” on the page:

```js
function Welcome(props) {  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
Let’s recap what happens in this example:

- We call ReactDOM.render() with the `<Welcome name="Sara" />` element.
- React calls the Welcome component with `{name: 'Sara'}` as the props.
- Our Welcome component returns a `<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>` element as the result.
- React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match `<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>`.
